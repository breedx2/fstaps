FlightStats taps
================

This project is a simple HTML display board for the taps at FlightStats.
It's adopts the ubiquitous chalkboard model, including some chalk-fonts
and blinding pastels.

It's written in python + flask with a little hand-rolled html + jquery.
Data is persisted in a yaml file.

There is no security -- any user can edit the tap list.

Please feel free to fork and make moar awesomer.
